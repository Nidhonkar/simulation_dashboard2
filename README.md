**Never "file not found":** If no Excel is detected, the app auto-loads a realistic **DEMO** dataset.
You can also paste a CSV/XLSX **URL** in the sidebar or upload files live.

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Deploy
- Push to GitHub (include the `data/DEMO.xlsx` or your own files in `data/`).
- On Streamlit Cloud set **Main file path** to `app.py`.
